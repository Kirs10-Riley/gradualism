# Progress Report 2

## Overview:

For the past three days I was studing Ross' s file. I think the whole assignment could be summerizing into  four steps:

1. Organizing the original PDF files (Annecy, Geneva, Torquay documents);

2. Extracting the texts in PDF files and digitalizing them in Rstudio (converting pictures into characters);

3. Cleaning the data in R and reorganizing them so that it can be converted into EXCEL file (make it readable and nice looking);

4. Manually cleaning the data and summarizing some basic features in the EXCEL.

Thanks for Ross's codes and description and some other online resources, I am now able to deal with the first two steps, namely **PDF->R**ï¼Œbut the coding part in step 3 is more complicated and requires further digestion and experiment.


## Moving forward:

Hopefully I will have understood the coding in the third step by the end of next week (June 28th). To do this, given that there are available organized pdf files on Github, I will try to use them to replicate the result that Ross has already accomplished. If I succeed, the result should be similar to file "Torquay_ALL_Schedules", then I can move back to step one and start organizing the remaining pdf files (Torquay schedule 16, Annecy, Geneva).

## Some other notes:

1. There are around 30 pages left in Torquay pdf that are not coded yet. If they are relevant, then I guess schedule 16 is needed. But we can decide it after I finish the coding part.

2. Although it is not the priority right now, I happened to find out that in the Annecy pdf file, from page 413, the files is written in French. I am not sure whether it is new information or repeated one with just a change of language, so for now I will just leave it there and look into it when doing the step 1 later.
