## Work done this week
 

  * Corrected the Benelux concession documents.
  * Corrected the Australia concession documents.
  * Finished reading _Tariff negotiations and renegotiations under the WTO_.
  
## Content of the session
  
  * R problem: the document should be treated differently. It will be done under the text editor and read through read.delim.
  * Data analysis: the data should take into account the data on the document rather than a computed data. The calculation of the concession would be done through R. Moreover, in order to limit the text format of the data a new column would be created to indicate the units.
  * Hoda's book: membership, base rate, renegotiations and supplementary negotiations at the GATT (the participation issue).

## Work for the next week

  * Summarize _Traders and diplomats_ and  _Tariff negotiations and renegotiations under the WTO_.
  * Add the products that are recorded in the complaints at the GATT session with the USA as defendant in the industry list.
  * The need to review some documents: concession documents (7 digits code).
  * Modify the input documents according to the remarks made during the session.
