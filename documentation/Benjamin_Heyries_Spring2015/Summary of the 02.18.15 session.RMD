## Work done this week

  * Finish the summary on Read _The GATT legal system and World Trade Diplomacy_ by Robert Hudec
  * Find the WTO data on the tariff agreement per country and per conference
  * Start reading _Traders and diplomats_
  
## Content of the session

  * Discussion on the GitHub problem about notification of merging modification
  * Some leads to research on: the major supplier rule associated with the most favored nation status against bilateral negotiations; the transition of the EEC from separated contracting parties to a single one; the Schelling prize speech on the effect of the executive negotiating; 
  * The procedure for gathering the data: take the concession of the US toward a developed country and a developing country that would be present during the different round. Two possibilities: Brazil and Australia. This will be a one-way concession in order to keep the model simple. 

## Work for the next week

  * Finish reading _Traders and diplomats_ 
  * Start gathering the data 
  * Make some quick research about the leads in order to clarify the general model
