## Examples

Listed below are the pictures of our source file. In particular, we presented the product **"Hexamethylenetetramine"** in three files, it has paragraph number 40 in the Smoot Hawley tariff system (In file Torquay consolidated and Geneva47) and is assigned code 425.73 in the TSUSA system. As we can see in the below figures, the schedules usually consist of three parts: Tariff paragraph (TSUSA code), Product description and Rate of duty, and the structure of our data set also follows this framework.

## Free list product

The free list schedule is relatively special compared to previous schedules. The products in the free list all are free of duty, and more importantly unlike the normal products in previous schedules 1-15, the free list products cover across many industries, the similarity they share is the industrial characteristic of the product itself, the the common feature of "free of duty". Therefore we have not included them in the main data set but documented them in a separate file. However this arrangement of specifying "free list" was changed in the TSUSA system, by both keyword search and cross-reference table, we identified most of the free list products from Smoot-Hawley in TSUSA and found out that they are now within the industrial section, among the normal products, despite of the unchanged "free of duty" tax rate.

One more interesting observation about the free list product is that they actually entered the GATT negotiation gradually. To be more specific, in each round only some of the free list products are included in the tariff schedule, but how about the rest of the free list products, are they "free of duty" as well? If so, why not including them in the negotiated tariff schedule? So far we don't have a solid answer for this question, our best guess is that the 1930 Tariff Act is more of a unilateral tariff schedule that was only bounded or dependent by (on) the US government which means that the president of US, or other related authorities can adjust the rate when necessary; however the negotiated GATT schedules are multi-national MFN tariff which have strict restrictions on unilateral tariff changes. This implies that if  a free list product was free in the 1930 Tariff Act, but not included in the free list in the GATT negotiated schedules, then the reason behind it could be that the US government wanted to have more control and flexibility on this product even it was free of duty at that moment. We found most of the free list products were included (and still free) in the TSUSA system, but we still lack of the information on these products within the period of the first round of Geneva and Dillon round. More work will be done with respect to this part in the near future.

## Special lines

There are several interesting cases of special lines during the data collection work, we will discuss them in this section:

 1. **Tariff intervals**: one interesting type of description is the tariff interval, to be more specific, the tax rates for certain products have extra maximum and minimum tax rate besides their usually rates. For example Paragraph 210 210 Rockingham earthenware in the Geneva 1947 document has its tax rate description as *"20 cents per doz. articles, but not less 7.5% nor more than 25%"*. To incorporate this kind of narrative tax rate formula, we followed the same approach used in **Torquay consolidated** when also in later TSUSA round, that is to divide the single line of product into multiple lines based on different values of the product. For the same product in **Torquay consolidated**, it is documented in three separate lines: *"Rockingham earthenware, valued per dozen articles: under 80 cents - 25% ad valorem"*,  *"Rockingham earthenware, valued per dozen articles: over 80 cents and under 266.67 cents - 20 cents per doz, articles"* and  *"Rockingham earthenware, valued per dozen articles: over 266.67 cents - 7.5% ad valorem"*. Notice that the threshold value for each line is calculated based on the minimum and maximum of applied tax rate. With this method, we manually transformed all the tax interval type lines into separate lines based on their values. One thing to notice is that, as the tax rates were reduced across rounds, some of the threshold value of these rounds may also change, however these changes are usually trivial and it will add unnecessary lines to the structure we created, therefore we will just the original line and threshold value unless the tax interval fomula itself changed over time.
 
 2. **Splitting lines**: another typical situation we dealt with during the digitization process is the splitting line. Since the original product description in 1930 Tariff Act is relatively general and ambiguous, we find some more specified lines in later round. An example of this is Paragraph 24 *"Flavoring extracts, and natural or synthetic fruit flavors, fruit esters, oils, and essences, all the foregoing and their combinations:"* was not specified in Geneva 1947 document (which is the same description as in 1930 Tariff Act), but in Dillon round the paragraph is further divided into *"Flavoring extracts, and natural or synthetic fruit flavors, fruit esters, oils, and essences, all the foregoing and their combinations: unfit for beverage purposes, containing of alcohol ..."* and *"Flavoring extracts, and natural or synthetic fruit flavors, fruit esters, oils, and essences, all the foregoing and their combinations: fit for beverage purposes, containing of alcohol ..."*. More restrictions or new types were introduced as the tariff system improved. To deal with these splitting lines, we first create new lines for them, and also entered uniform tax rate for them before the round of the splitting or new lines showed up, in this way we keep the completeness of the schedule and avoid losing information on differentiated products.
 
 3. **Staging**: in Dillon round and Geneva 1956 round, the tax reduction happened in multiple stages. There are plural columns in the schedule indicating that the tax rate will be lower and lower in every period^[Geneva 1956 has 3 stages while Dillon round has two stages], usually there is one year period of effectiveness between the two stages, that means for every tax rate in the first stage, it should be at least to be effective for year and then the tax rate of that product goes to the rate of the next column. Although most of the products went through this staging process, some products remain the same tax rate for more than one stages. To deal with this staging problem, we created separated columns for these stages and track the tariff reduction aross stages, but when comparing the tax reduction across rounds, we will only compare the tax rate in the final stage.
