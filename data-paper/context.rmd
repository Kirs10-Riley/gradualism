In this paper, we are examining the extended episode of tariff liberalization that took place in the post-World War II period primarily from the point of view of the United States of America. The U.S. was arguably *the* driving force behind the GATT, and it was responding to a very specific sequence of events both at home and on the world stage.

## The Smoot-Hawley Tariffs of 1930 and the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934

In the midst of the Great Depression, U.S. President Herbert Hoover's proposal to increase tariffs to protect the agricultural sector turned into the large and general upward revision of the U.S. tariff schedule in the Tariff Act of 1930, known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. President Hoover intended that tariffs would be reduced under the flexible tariff provisions of Smoot-Hawley. However, regret at the economic damage wrought by the tariff increases as well as frustration with the cumbersome and time consuming process for reducing those tariffs, led to calls for a change (Dobson 1976).

That change came in the form of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA). Framed as an amendment to the Smoot-Hawley Act---as would all tariff bills be until 1962--the RTAA authorized the President of the United States to change tariff rates by as much as 50% with only the need to notify the public of his intentions. With this delegation of tariff setting powers to the president, the Smoot-Hawley act was Congress's last general revision of the U.S. tariff.

Twenty eight country subcommittees were created to formulate tariff cut proposals based on the principal supplier rule. One of the top three suppliers of a commodity would be offered a tariff cut in return for reciprocal liberalization for U.S. goods. Then---somewhat surprisingly in retrospect---the unconditional most-favored-nation principle would be applied to any tariff concession so that it was automatically and freely extended to all other suppliers, with the exception of a few communist countries (Dobson 1976).

## The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) / Geneva 1947

By the mid 1940's, the United States had negotiated bilateral trade agreements with more than twenty countries and wished to continue the reciprocal trade agreements program. Because it had already made the maximum allowable reduction---50 percent---under the RTAA for about 42 percent of dutiable imports (also in Irwin 2017), President Truman asked for additional authority to cut tariffs. In the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1945, Congress gave the president the authority to reduce any tariff by 50 percent of the January 1, 1945 rate. Irwin (2017) argues that this was the "high point of legislative support for the trade agreements program," facilitated in part because supply shortages---not import competition---were the focal issue in the midst of World War II.

With this negotiating authority in hand, President Truman's administration instigated multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland starting in April 1947. The talks lasted until October 19, 1947 and produced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

The negotiations in Geneva were multilateral in principle, but in fact the way they were carried out was similar to the way the U.S. had operated since 1934 under the RTAA: a team from each country negotiated bilaterally with the representatives of several other countries on a product-by-product basis using the principal supplier rule (Irwin 2017). Once these bilateral talks were complete, each country created a single, consolidated schedule of tariffs that would be granted to all other contracting parties on a most-favored-nation basis. These schedules were annexed to the GATT.

As U.S. legislation only required the president to give public notice of his intention to negotiate a trade agreement and then to "seek information and advice," the United States made its concessions effective as of January 1948 by executive order (Dobson 1976). The GATT was purely a trade agreement, not a treaty or an organization, and thus instead of members it has "contracting parties" (Irwin 2017).

## The Annecy Round

The second round of GATT negotiations in April to October 1949---known as the Annecy Round---was decidedly different from the first. Most notably, this round was focused on the accession of eleven new contracting parties. The parties to the original GATT only negotiated with the new members and not with each other (Irwin 2017).

This is not the only reason, however, that the U.S. made far fewer concessions than in the Geneva Round. As its overseas expenditures related to the war had led to a difficult balance of payments situation, there was more political opposition by the time the president's negotiating authority had to be renewed in 1948. For the first time, Congress instituted the 'peril point' procedure, by which trade negotiations had to be preceded by an investigation into the potential harms to industry of trade liberalization (Dobson 1976).

## The Torquay Round

U.S. negotiators were able to work with less constraints in the third GATT round at Torquay from late 1950 to the spring of 1951, as The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 extended negotiating authority for two years and also revoked the peril point rules. Seven new contracting parties were added---including West Germany---and concessions were exchanged among both the old and new adherents. When the Torquay agreement went into effect, the GATT had 34 contracting parties who accounted for about 80% of world trade (Irwin 2017).

## The Second Geneva Round ("Geneva 1956")

Congress re-implemented the peril point provision in 1951 and it was not revoked until 1962 so that both Geneva 1956 and the Dillon Rounds were negotiated under the peril point constraint, reducing the flexibility of U.S. trade negotiators. The 1955 Extension of the RTAA allowed only a 15% reduction in tariffs---except for very high tariffs that could be reduced to 50%---and required that the reductions be phased-in in 3 installments. This was the first time under the RTAA that tariff cuts were phased in (Irwin 2017). Geneva 1956 notably added Japan as a contracting party.

## The Dillon Round

The Dillon Round took place from 1960 to 1962 and differed from the second Geneva round in that President Eisenhower occasionally allowed the negotiators to make tariff cuts below the peril point levels in order to get key concessions. These tariff cuts had to be justified to Congress, but did not threaten implementation of the agreement via executive order.

The 1958 renewal of the RTAA again granted limited negotiating authority: it allowed 20% reductions in tariffs with larger reductions for tariffs that remained about 50%. Negotiating authority under this renewal lasted for four years; the Dillon Round ended in June 1962 just before time ran out.

## The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Kennedy Round

The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 was the first trade bill since 1930 to stand on its own instead of being cast as a revision of the Smoot-Hawley Act. It authorized President Kennedy's administration to reduce tariff rates by 50 percent of the July 1, 1962 rate, except for a few excluded products and products that already had a rate of 5 percent *ad valorem* or less. For the latter, the tariff could be removed entirely. It also removed the peril point requirement.

Taken together, this meant that U.S. trade negotiators would have far more flexibility in the Kennedy Round than in any round since Geneva 1947. Another difference between Kennedy and preceding rounds is that it would be negotiated using a new tariff classification system. The Tariff Classification Act of 1962 replaced the Smoot-Hawley paragraph system with the Tariff System of the United States (TSUS), effective August 31, 1963 (Dobson 1976). This was the culmination of a process that started with the Trade Agreement Extension Act of 1953, which directed the Tariff Commission (the predecessor to the USITC) to make a proposal to revise and consolidate U.S. trade laws after producing a comprehensive study of those laws.

In contrast to the Smoot-Hawley system, the TSUS was hierarchical. It was arranged into eight *sectors* in contrast to Smoot-Hawley's fifteen *schedules*, moving from unprocessed goods to finished goods and then broken into 5-digit codes. The Tariff Schedules of the Unites States Annotated (TSUSA) added two further digits as statistical---as opposed to legal---categories. That is, tariffs did not vary below the five-digit level; rather, the additional digits applied to the collection of import data. The TSUS provided descriptions of articles by name, seeking to avoid the more general descriptions found in the Smoot-Hawley paragraphs, such as by material of manufacture (Rosengarten et. al 2017).

With the new tariff nomenclature in place, in October 1963 President Kennedy asked the Tariff Commission to provide a study of the possible economic effects of liberalizing nearly every article in the new TSUS in a new round of GATT negotiations. Talks got underway in May 1964 for what became known as the Kennedy Round and ran until June 30, 1967, the day that U.S. negotiating authority under the Trade Expansion Act expired (Dobson 1976).

The Kennedy round began with 46 countries participating and ended with 70, although developing countries did not negotiate (Irwin 2017). For the first time, the major trading countries made across-the-board cuts instead of negotiating item-by-item, which resulted in it being "one of the most comprehensive rounds of international trade negotiations ever held" (Dobson 1976) up to that time. Cuts were to be staged over five years from 1968 to 1972 and covered most items, although separate provisions for trade in textiles had been carved out in the 1962 Long Term Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (LTA).

## The Tokyo Round

Negotiating authority had lapsed in 1967 (Irwin 2017), so President Nixon was without authority to negotiate when the Tokyo Round began in September 1973. The Trade Act of 1974 granted five years of authority to negotiate tariff reductions of as much as 60 percent and to reduce to zero any tariff whose rate was less than five percent on January 1, 1975.\^[Note that by the time the act passed, Gerald R Ford had become president.]

The Trade Act of 1974 authorized the president to grant most-favored-nation status to countries who were not already receiving it and also instituted the fast track procedure. Fast track required Congress to give an up/down vote on legislation implementing non-tariff provisions, which still could be instituted by executive order. After the non-tariff provisions of the Kennedy Round were not able to be passed through Congress, the countries affected were loathe to negotiate with the U.S. without such a procedure in place.

Tariffs were again reduced by formula instead of item-by-item, and talks concluded in April 1979. During the course of the negotiations, the LTA had been replaced by the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) in 1974. A second MFA was concluded in 1977.

## The Uruguay Round

Amidst strong protectionist pressures, the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 withheld negotiating authority from President Regan. The Uruguay Round therefore began in 1986 without the U.S having the authority to negotiate. However, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 guaranteed fast track procedures and provided authority to reduce tariffs by up to 50 percent within three years with a two-year extension unless Congress objected (Irwin 2017).\^[Several bills to object to the two-year extension were defeated in in 1991 (Irwin 2017).]

The 1988 act also replaced the TSUS, effective January 1, 1989, with a new tariff system. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) was the U.S.'s implementation of the new international Harmonized System (HS). Although the Uruguay Round was underway, the tariff that were in place at the time had to be aligned with the new system, requiring extensive notifications and negotiations with GATT partners since some rate changes were necessary to complete the alignment (Rosengarten et. al 2017).

The Uruguay Round was concluded on December 15, 1993 after seven years of negotiations. The resulting agreement updated the GATT, abolished the MFA, and formed the World Trade Organization (among other achievements). It was signed by 117 nations in April 1994 and took effect on January 1, 1995 (Irwin 2017).
