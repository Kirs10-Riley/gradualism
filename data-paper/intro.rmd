Large-scale tariff reductions within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have come as a result of a series of eight rounds of negotiations that began in 1947. Most of the literature that attempts to understand this phenomenon is theoretical, in large part because data availability has been a major barrier to empirical research on this massive dismantling of trade barriers.\footnote{See, for instance, the literature that seeks to explain the gradual nature of this liberalization, e.g. Devereaux (1997) and  Chisik (2003) who focus on exporters; Mussa (1986), Staiger (1995) or Mehlum (1998) on the import-competing story; or Zissimos (2007) on the role of the `withdrawal of equivalent concessions' rule.} Bown and Irwin (2017) have documented the available data, finding it to be frustratingly sparse. The data they find are applied tariffs--i.e. those that are actually charged at the border---and are disaggregated to the level of ten broad sectors at most. 

As little as we know about applied tariffs in this context, we know even less about the negotiated tariff bindings. Somewhat surprisingly, data on the tariff commitments made by the GATT signees has not been widely available, preventing empirical studies on the workings of the GATT and the dynamics of this important episode of trade liberalization.\footnote{One notable exception is Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2000) who digitize the bilateral negotiation records for the Torquay Round. In order to use the bilateral data they have, one would have to digitize and combine all of a country's bilateral commitments.}

Both having more industrial detail about tariffs and having this detail be for negotiated tariffs is important. First, the negotiated tariff commitments allow us to study the political constraints that led to the GATT agreements. The negotiated tariffs are the cleanest data that exist for all negotiating parties since they are not complicated by the various processes that determine applied tariffs. Second, often the most relevant object in terms of policymaking is the gap between the negotiated tariff and the applied tariff; this is known as tariff overhang or ``water'' in the bindings.\footnote{See, for instance, Beshkar and Bond (2016), Bown and Crowley (2014), Busch and Pelc (2014), and Kuenzel (2020).} Even if we know what the applied tariffs were, we can’t know how much water is in the bindings if we don’t also know the negotiated tariff caps.
