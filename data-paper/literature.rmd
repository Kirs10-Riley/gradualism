There is a large qualitative literature on the history of U.S. trade policy and the GATT. Irwin (2017) provides a comprehensive history of U.S. trade policy, while Hoda (2018) reports a general history of the GATT. Dobson (1976) focuses on the deep history of the USITC, while Rosengarten et al. (2017) focus on the USITCs tariff activities.

    -   Go back and list some of the books we read on, e.g., each round

    -   1994 Irwin NBER working paper
    -   Irwin (2020)?

    -   Petros' chapter on tariffs

-   Three strands of quantitative literature

    -   Old stuff

        -   Krause 1962, etc

            -   Go through reference list

        -   Dur, Balassa, Kreinin

    -   BSY (is there a second one?)

    -   Data since HS (some TSUS from Feenstra?)

        -   Bown and Irwin (2017)

        -   But what about "30 years of trade policy"?
