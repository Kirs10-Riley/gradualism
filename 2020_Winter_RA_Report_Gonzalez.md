# Progress Report 1 (12/1/2020)

1. Tuesday, Dec. 1st.
    - My goal today is to develop a system for managing contributions to GitHub via Git. This report should indicate my level of success...
    - In terms of the actual project, I have received a hard copy of of the Geneva47 (Thanks Victor!):
        - My next step will be to work through the "Schedules_1-15_units_changed_HS" file in the G:drive.
        - Here, I expect to compare entries between the hardcopy Geneva47 and the data in the file to verify previous work.
        - Finally, Victor mentioned to pay specific attention to the highlighted sections. I will keep this in mind. 
    - I expect my progress this week to be fairly slow, but will be much more available in the weeks to come.
